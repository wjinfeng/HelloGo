# Introduction
- This repo is a `Go` beginner's code exercises.
- All `.go` files are code exercises of [《The GO Programming Language》](http://books.studygolang.com/gopl-zh/) , and I will try my best to writes as detailed comments as possible in the code to ensure that someone could understand the current code file without consulting external materials.
